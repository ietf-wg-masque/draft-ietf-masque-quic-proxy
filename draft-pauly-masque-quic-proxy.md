--- abstract

This document defines an extension to UDP Proxying over HTTP
that adds specific optimizations for proxied QUIC connections. This extension
allows a proxy to reuse UDP 4-tuples for multiple connections. It also defines a
mode of proxying in which QUIC short header packets can be forwarded using an
HTTP/3 proxy rather than being re-encapsulated and re-encrypted.

# Introduction {#introduction}

UDP Proxying over HTTP {{!CONNECT-UDP=I-D.ietf-masque-connect-udp}}
defines a way to send datagrams through an HTTP proxy, where UDP is used to communicate
between the proxy and a target server. This can be used to proxy QUIC
connections {{!QUIC=RFC9000}}, since QUIC runs over UDP datagrams.

This document uses the term "target" to refer to the server that a client is
accessing via a proxy. This target may be an origin hosting content, or another
proxy.

This document extends the UDP proxying protocol to add signalling about QUIC
Connection IDs. QUIC Connection IDs are used to identify QUIC connections in
scenarios where there is not a strict bidirectional mapping between one QUIC
connection and one UDP 4-tuple (pairs of IP addresses and ports). A proxy that
is aware of Connection IDs can reuse UDP 4-tuples between itself and a target
for multiple proxied QUIC connections.

Awareness of Connection IDs also allows a proxy to avoid re-encapsulation and
re-encryption of proxied QUIC packets once a connection has been established.
When this functionality is present, the proxy can support two modes for handling
QUIC packets:

1. Tunnelled, in which client <-> target QUIC packets are encapsulated inside
client <-> proxy QUIC packets. These packets use multiple layers of encryption
and congestion control. QUIC long header packets MUST use this mode. QUIC short
header packets MAY use this mode. This is the default mode for UDP proxying.

2. Forwarded, in which client <-> target QUIC packets are sent directly over the
client <-> proxy UDP socket. These packets are only encrypted using the
client-target keys, and use the client-target congestion control. This mode MUST
only be used for QUIC short header packets.

Forwarded mode is defined as an optimization to reduce CPU processing on clients and
proxies, as well as avoiding MTU overhead for packets on the wire. This makes it
suitable for deployment situations that otherwise relied on cleartext TCP
proxies, which cannot support QUIC and have inferior security and privacy
properties.

The properties provided by the forwarded mode are as follows:

- All packets sent between the client and the target traverse through the proxy
device.
- The target server cannot know the IP address of the client solely based on the
proxied packets the target receives.
- Observers of either or both of the client <-> proxy link and the proxy <->
target are not able to learn more about the client <-> target communication than
if no proxy was used.

It is not a goal of forwarded mode to prevent correlation between client <->
proxy and the proxy <-> target packets from an entity that can observe both
links. See {{security}} for further discussion.

Both clients and proxies can unilaterally choose to disable forwarded mode for
any client <-> target connection.

The forwarded mode of this extension is only defined for HTTP/3
{{!HTTP3=I-D.ietf-quic-http}} and not any earlier versions of HTTP.

QUIC proxies only need to understand the Header Form bit, and the connection ID
fields from packets in client <-> target QUIC connections. Since these fields
are all in the QUIC invariants header {{!INVARIANTS=RFC8999}},
QUIC proxies can proxy all versions of QUIC.

## Conventions and Definitions {#conventions}

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 {{!RFC2119}} {{!RFC8174}}
when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

## Terminology

This document uses the following terms:

- Client: the client of all QUIC connections discussed in this document.
- Proxy: the endpoint that responds to the UDP proxying request.
- Target: the server that a client is accessing via a proxy.
- Client <-> Proxy HTTP stream: a single HTTP stream established from
the client to the proxy.
- Socket: a UDP 4-tuple (local IP address, local UDP port, remote IP address,
remote UDP port). In some implementations, this is referred to as a "connected"
socket.
- Client-facing socket: the socket used to communicate between the client and
the proxy.
- Target-facing socket: the socket used to communicate between the proxy and
the target.
- Client Connection ID: a QUIC Connection ID that is chosen by the client, and
is used in the Destination Connection ID field of packets from the target to
the client.
- Target Connection ID: a QUIC Connection ID that is chosen by the target, and
is used in the Destination Connection ID field of packets from the client to
the target.
- Virtual Client Connection ID: a fake QUIC Connection ID that is chosen by the
client that the proxy MUST use when sending QUIC packets in forwarded mode.
- Virtual Target Connection ID: a fake QUIC Connection ID that is chosen by the
proxy that the client MUST use when sending QUIC packets in forwarded mode.

## Virtual Connection IDs

QUIC allows each endpoint of a connection to choose the connection IDs it
receives with. Servers receiving QUIC packets can employ load balancing
strategies such as those described in {{?QUIC-LB=I-D.ietf-quic-load-balancers}}
that encode routing information in
the connection ID. When operating in forwarded mode, clients send QUIC packets
destined for the Target directly to the Proxy. Since these packets are generated
using the Target Connection ID, load balancers would not be able to route packets
to the correct Proxy if the packets were sent with the Target Connection ID.
The Virtual Target Connection ID is a connection ID chosen
by the Proxy that the Client uses when sending forwarded mode packets. The Proxy
replaces the Virtual Target Connection ID with the Target Connection ID prior to
forwarding the packet to the Target.

Similarly, QUIC requires that connection IDs aren't reused over multiple network
paths to avoid linkability. The Virtual Client Connection ID is a connection ID
chosen by the Client that the Proxy uses when sending forwarded mode packets.
The Proxy replaces the Client Connection ID with the Virtual Client Connection
ID prior to forwarding the packet to the Client. Clients take advantage of this
to avoid linkability when migrating a client to proxy network path. The Virtual
Client Connection ID allows the connection ID bytes to change on the wire
without requiring the connection IDs on the client to target connection change.

Clients and Proxies not implementing forwarded mode do not need to consider
Virtual Connection IDs since all Client<->Target datagrams will be encapsulated
within the Client<->Proxy connection.

# Required Proxy State {#mappings}

In the methods defined in this document, the proxy is aware of the QUIC
Connection IDs being used by proxied connections, along with the sockets
used to communicate with the client and the target. Tracking Connection IDs in
this way allows the proxy to reuse target-facing sockets for multiple
connections and support the forwarded mode of proxying.

QUIC packets can be either tunnelled within an HTTP proxy connection using
HTTP Datagram frames {{!HTTP-DGRAM=I-D.ietf-masque-h3-datagram}}, or be forwarded
directly alongside an HTTP/3 proxy connection on the same set of IP addresses and UDP
ports. The use of forwarded mode requires the consent of both the client and the
proxy.

In order to correctly route QUIC packets in both tunnelled and forwarded modes,
the proxy needs to maintain mappings between several items. There are three
required unidirectional mappings, described below.

## Stream Mapping

Each client <-> proxy HTTP stream MUST be mapped to a single target-facing socket.

~~~
(Client <-> Proxy HTTP Stream) => Target-facing socket
~~~

Multiple streams can map to the same target-facing socket, but a
single stream cannot be mapped to multiple target-facing sockets.

This mapping guarantees that any HTTP Datagram using a stream sent
from the client to the proxy in tunnelled mode can be sent to the correct
target.

## Virtual Target Connection ID Mapping

Each pair of Virtual Target Connection ID and client-facing socket MUST map to a
single target-facing socket and Target Connection ID.

~~~
(Client-facing socket + Virtual Target Connection ID)
    => (Target-facing socket + Target Connection ID)
~~~

Multiple pairs of Connection IDs and client-facing sockets can map to the
same target-facing socket.

This mapping guarantees that any QUIC packet containing the Virtual Target
Connection ID sent from the client to the proxy in forwarded mode can be sent to
the correct target with the correct Target Connection ID. Thus, a proxy that
does not allow forwarded mode does not need to maintain this mapping.

## Client Connection ID Mappings

Each pair of Client Connection ID and target-facing socket MUST map to a single
stream on a single client <-> proxy HTTP stream. Additionally, when supporting
forwarded mode, the pair of Client Connection ID and target-facing socket MUST
map to a single client-facing socket and Virtual Client Connection ID.

~~~
(Target-facing socket + Client Connection ID) => (Client <-> Proxy HTTP Stream)
(Target-facing socket + Client Connection ID)
    => (Client-facing socket + Virtual Client Connection ID)
~~~

Multiple pairs of Connection IDs and target-facing sockets can map to the same
HTTP stream or client-facing socket.

These mappings guarantee that any QUIC packet sent from a target to the proxy
can be sent to the correct client, in either tunnelled or forwarded mode. Note
that this mapping becomes trivial if the proxy always opens a new target-facing
socket for every client request with a unique stream. The mapping is
critical for any case where target-facing sockets are shared or reused.

## Detecting Connection ID Conflicts {#conflicts}

In order to be able to route packets correctly in both tunnelled and forwarded
mode, proxies check for conflicts before creating a new mapping. If a conflict
is detected, the proxy will reject the client's request, as described in
{{proxy-behavior}}.

Two sockets conflict if and only if all members of the 4-tuple (local IP
address, local UDP port, remote IP address, and remote UDP port) are identical.

Two Connection IDs conflict if and only if one Connection ID is equal to or a
prefix of another. For example, a zero-length Connection ID conflicts with all
connection IDs. This definition of a conflict originates from the fact that
QUIC short headers do not carry the length of the Destination Connection ID
field, and therefore if two short headers with different Destination Connection
IDs are received on a shared socket, one being a prefix of the other prevents
the receiver from identifying which mapping this corresponds to.

The proxy treats two mappings as being in conflict when a conflict is detected
for all elements on the left side of the mapping diagrams above.

Since very short Connection IDs are more likely to lead to conflicts,
particularly zero-length Connection IDs, a proxy MAY choose to reject all
requests for very short Connection IDs as conflicts, in anticipation of future
conflicts.

## Stateless Resets for Forwarded Mode QUIC Packets

While the lifecycle of forwarding rules are bound to the lifecycle of the
client<->proxy HTTP stream, a peer may not be aware that the stream has
terminated. If the above mappings are lost or removed without the peer's
knowledge, they may send forwarded mode packets even though the Client
or Proxy no longer has state for that connection. To allow the Client or
Proxy to reset the client<->target connection in the absence the mappings
above, a stateless reset token corresponding to the Virtual Connection ID
can be provided.

Consider a proxy that initiates closure of a client<->proxy QUIC connection.
If the client is temporarily unresponsive or unreachable, the proxy might have
considered the connection closed and removed all connection state (including
the stream mappings used for forwarding). If the client never learned about the closure, it
might send forwarded mode packets to the proxy, assuming the stream mappings
and client<->proxy connection are still intact. The proxy will receive these
forwarded mode packets, but won't have any state corresponding to the
destination connection ID in the packet. If the proxy has provided a stateless
reset token for the Virtual Target Connection ID, it can send a stateless reset
packet to quickly notify the client that the client<->target connection is
broken.

## Stateless Resets from the Target

Reuse of target-facing sockets is only possible because QUIC connection IDs
allow distinguishing packets for multiple QUIC connections received with the
same 5-tuple. One exception to this is Stateless Reset packets, in which the
connection ID is not used, but rather populated with unpredictable bits followed
by a Stateless Reset token, to make it indistinguishable from a regular packet
with a short header. In order for the proxy to correctly recognize Stateless
Reset packets, the client SHOULD share the Stateless Reset token for each
registered Target Connection ID. When the proxy receives a Stateless Reset packet,
it can send the packet to the client as a tunnelled datagram. Although Stateless Reset packets
look like short header packets, they are not technically short header packets and do not contain
negotiated connection IDs, and thus are not eligible for forwarded mode.

# Connection ID Capsule Types

Proxy awareness of QUIC Connection IDs relies on using capsules ({{HTTP-DGRAM}})
to signal the addition and removal of Client and Target Connection IDs.

Note that these capsules do not register contexts. QUIC packets are encoded
using HTTP Datagrams with the context ID set to zero as defined in
{{CONNECT-UDP}}.

The capsules used for QUIC-aware proxying allow a client to register connection
IDs with the proxy, and for the proxy to acknowledge or reject the connection
ID mappings.

The REGISTER_CLIENT_CID and REGISTER_TARGET_CID capsule types (see
{{iana-capsule-types}} for the capsule type values) allow a client to inform
the proxy about a new Client Connection ID or a new Target Connection ID,
respectively. These capsule types MUST only be sent by a client.

The ACK_CLIENT_CID and ACK_TARGET_CID capsule types (see {{iana-capsule-types}}
for the capsule type values) are sent by the proxy to the client to indicate
that a mapping was successfully created for a registered connection ID as well
as provide the Virtual Target Connection ID that may be used in forwarded mode.
These capsule types MUST only be sent by a proxy.

The CLOSE_CLIENT_CID and CLOSE_TARGET_CID capsule types (see
{{iana-capsule-types}} for the capsule type values) allow either a client
or a proxy to remove a mapping for a connection ID. These capsule types
MAY be sent by either a client or the proxy. If a proxy sends a
CLOSE_CLIENT_CID without having sent an ACK_CLIENT_CID, or if a proxy
sends a CLOSE_TARGET_CID without having sent an ACK_TARGET_CID,
it is rejecting a Connection ID registration.

ACK_CLIENT_CID, CLOSE_CLIENT_CID, and CLOSE_TARGET_CID capsule types are
formatted as follows:

~~~
Connection ID Capsule {
  Type (i) = 0xffe402, 0xffe404, 0xffe405
  Length (i),
  Connection ID (0..2040),
}
~~~
{: #fig-capsule-cid title="Connection ID Capsule Format"}

Connection ID:
: A connection ID being acknowledged, which is between 0 and 255 bytes in
length. The length of the connection ID is implied by the length of the
capsule. Note that in QUICv1, the length of the Connection ID is limited
to 20 bytes, but QUIC invariants allow up to 255 bytes.

The REGISTER_TARGET_CID capsule includes the target-provided connection ID
and Stateless Reset Token.

~~~
Register Target Connection ID Capsule {
  Type (i) = 0xffe401
  Length (i),
  Connection ID Length (i)
  Connection ID (0..2040),
  Stateless Reset Token Length (i),
  Stateless Reset Token (..),
}
~~~
{: #fig-capsule-register-target-cid title="Register Target Connection ID Capsule Format"}

Connection ID Length
: The length of the connection ID being registered, which is between 0 and
255. Note that in QUICv1, the length of the Connection ID is limited to 20
bytes, but QUIC invariants allow up to 255 bytes.

Connection ID
: A connection ID being registered whose length is equal to Connection ID
Length. This is the real Target or Client Connection ID.

Stateless Reset Token Length
: The length of the target-provided Stateless Reset Token.

Stateless Reset Token
: The target-provided Stateless Reset token allowing the proxy to correctly
recognize Stateless Reset packets to be tunneled to the client.

The REGISTER_CLIENT_CID and ACK_TARGET_CID capsule types include a Virtual
Connection ID and Stateless Reset Token.

~~~
Virtual Connection ID Capsule {
  Type (i) = 0xffe400, 0xffe403
  Length (i)
  Connection ID Length (i)
  Connection ID (0..2040),
  Virtual Connection ID Length (i)
  Virtual Connection ID (0..2040),
  Stateless Reset Token Length (i),
  Stateless Reset Token (..),
}
~~~
{: #fig-capsule-virtual-cid title="Virtual Connection ID Capsule Format"}

Connection ID Length
: The length of the connection ID being registered or acknowledged, which
is between 0 and 255. Note that in QUICv1, the length of the Connection ID
is limited to 20 bytes, but QUIC invariants allow up to 255 bytes.

Connection ID
: A connection ID being registered or acknowledged whose length is equal to
Connection ID Length. This is the real Target or Client Connection ID.

Virtual Connection ID Length
: The length of the virtual connection ID being provided. This MUST be a valid
connection ID length for the QUIC version used in the client<->proxy QUIC
connection. When forwarded mode is not negotiated, the length MUST be zero.
The Virtual Connection ID Length and Connection ID Length SHOULD be equal
when possible to avoid the need to resize packets during replacement.

Virtual Connection ID
: The peer-chosen connection ID that the sender of forwarded mode packets MUST
use when sending. The endpoint rewrites forwarded mode packets to contain the
correct Connection ID prior to sending them.

Stateless Reset Token Length
: The length of the stateless reset token that may be sent by the client or
proxy in response to forwarded mode packets in order to reset the
Client<->Target QUIC connection. When forwarded mode is not negotiated, the
length MUST be zero. Proxies or Clients choosing not to support stateless
resets MAY set the length to zero. Clients or Proxies receiving a zero-length
stateless reset token MUST ignore it.

Stateless Reset Token
: A Stateless Reset Token allowing reset of the Client<->Target connection in
response to Client<->Target forwarded mode packets.

# Client Behavior {#client-behavior}

A client initiates UDP proxying via a CONNECT request as defined
in {{CONNECT-UDP}}. Within its request, it includes the "Proxy-QUIC-Forwarding"
header to indicate whether or not the request should support forwarding.
If this header is not included, the client MUST NOT send any connection ID
capsules.

The "Proxy-QUIC-Forwarding" is an Item Structured Header {{!RFC8941}}. Its
value MUST be a Boolean. Its ABNF is:

~~~
    Proxy-QUIC-Forwarding = sf-boolean
~~~

If the client wants to enable QUIC packet forwarding for this request, it sets
the value to "?1". If it doesn't want to enable forwarding, but instead only
provide information about QUIC Connection IDs for the purpose of allowing
the proxy to share a target-facing socket, it sets the value to "?0".

If the proxy supports QUIC-aware proxying, it will include the
"Proxy-QUIC-Forwarding" header in successful HTTP responses. The value
indicates whether or not the proxy supports forwarding. If the client does
not receive this header in responses, the client SHALL assume that the proxy
does not support this extension.

The client sends a REGISTER_CLIENT_CID capsule whenever it advertises a new
Client Connection ID to the target, and a REGISTER_TARGET_CID capsule when
it has received a new Target Connection ID for the target. In order to change
the connection ID bytes on the wire, a client can update a previously advertised Virtual Client
Connection ID by sending a new REGISTER_CLIENT_CID with the same Connection ID,
but a different Virtual Connection ID. Similarly, the client may solicit a new
Virtual Target Connection ID by sending a REGISTER_TARGET_CID capsule with
a previously registered Target Connection ID. Clients are responsible for
changing Virtual Connection IDs when the HTTP stream's network path changes to
avoid linkability across network paths. Note that initial
REGISTER_CLIENT_CID capsules MAY be sent prior to receiving an HTTP response
from the proxy.

## New Proxied Connection Setup

To initiate QUIC-aware proxying, the client sends a REGISTER_CLIENT_CID
capsule containing the initial Client Connection ID that the client has
advertised to the target as well as a Virtual Connection ID that the proxy MUST
use when sending forwarded mode packets. If forwarded mode is not supported,
the Virtual Connection ID Length MUST be zero.

If the mapping is created successfully, the client will receive a
ACK_CLIENT_CID capsule that contains the same Client Connection ID that was
requested.

Since clients are always aware whether or not they are using a QUIC proxy,
clients are expected to cooperate with proxies in selecting Client Connection
IDs. A proxy detects a conflict when it is not able to create a unique mapping
using the Client Connection ID ({{conflicts}}). It can reject requests that
would cause a conflict and indicate this to the client by replying with a
CLOSE_CLIENT_CID capsule. In order to avoid conflicts, clients SHOULD select
Client Connection IDs of at least 8 bytes in length with unpredictable values.
A client also SHOULD NOT select a Client Connection ID that matches the ID used
for the QUIC connection to the proxy, as this inherently creates a conflict.

If the rejection indicated a conflict due to the Client Connection ID, the
client MUST select a new Connection ID before sending a new request, and
generate a new packet. For example, if a client is sending a QUIC Initial
packet and chooses a Connection ID that conflicts with an existing mapping
to the same target server, it will need to generate a new QUIC Initial.

## Adding New Client Connection IDs

Since QUIC connection IDs are chosen by the receiver, an endpoint needs to
communicate its chosen connection IDs to its peer before the peer can start
using them. In QUICv1, this is performed using the NEW_CONNECTION_ID frame.

Prior to informing the target of a new chosen client connection ID, the client
MUST send a REGISTER_CLIENT_CID capsule request containing the new Client
Connection ID and Virtual Client Connection ID.

The client should only inform the target of the new Client Connection ID once an
ACK_CLIENT_CID capsule is received that contains the echoed connection ID.

## Sending With Forwarded Mode

Support for forwarded mode is determined by the "Proxy-QUIC-Forwarding" header,
see {{proxy-behavior}}.

Once the client has learned the target server's Connection ID, such as in the
response to a QUIC Initial packet, it can send a REGISTER_TARGET_CID capsule
containing the Target Connection ID to request the ability to forward packets.

The client MUST wait for an ACK_TARGET_CID capsule that contains the echoed
connection ID and Virtual Target Connection ID before using forwarded mode.

Prior to receiving the proxy server response, the client MUST send short header
packets tunnelled in HTTP Datagram frames. The client MAY also choose to tunnel
some short header packets even after receiving the successful response.

If the Target Connection ID registration is rejected, for example with a
CLOSE_TARGET_CID capsule, it MUST NOT forward packets to the requested Target
Connection ID, but only use tunnelled mode. The request might also be rejected
if the proxy does not support forwarded mode or has it disabled by policy.

QUIC long header packets MUST NOT be forwarded. These packets can only be
tunnelled within HTTP Datagram frames to avoid exposing unnecessary connection
metadata.

When forwarding, the client sends a QUIC packet with the Virtual Target
Connection ID in the QUIC short header, using the same socket between client and
proxy that was used for the main QUIC connection between client and proxy.

When forwarding, the proxy sends a QUIC packet with the Virtual Client Target
Connection ID in the QUIC short header, using the same socket between client
and proxy that was used for the main QUIC connection between client and proxy.

Prior to sending a forwarded mode packet, the sender MUST replace the Connection
ID with the Virtual Connection ID. If the Virtual Connection ID is larger than
the Connection ID, the sender MUST extend the length of the packet by the
difference between the two lengths, to include the entire Virtual Connection ID.
If the Virtual Connection ID is smaller than the Connection ID, the sender MUST
shrink the length of the packet by the difference between the two lengths.

Clients and proxies supporting forwarded mode MUST be able to handle Virtual
Connection IDs of different lengths than the corresponding Connection IDs.

## Receiving With Forwarded Mode

If the client has indicated support for forwarded mode with the "Proxy-QUIC-Forwarding"
header, the proxy MAY use forwarded mode for any Client Connection ID for which
it has a valid mapping.

Once a client has sent "Proxy-QUIC-Forwarding" with a value of "?1", it MUST be
prepared to receive forwarded short header packets on the socket between itself
and the proxy for any Virtual Client Connection ID that it has registered with a
REGISTER_CLIENT_CID capsule. The client uses the Destination Connection ID field
of the received packet to determine if the packet was originated by the proxy,
or merely forwarded from the target. The client replaces the Virtual Client
Connection ID with the real Client Connection ID before processing the packet further.

# Proxy Behavior {#proxy-behavior}

Upon receipt of a CONNECT request that includes the "Proxy-QUIC-Forwarding"
header, the proxy indicates to the client that it supports QUIC-aware proxying
by including a "Proxy-QUIC-Forwarding" header in a successful response.
If it supports QUIC packet forwarding, it sets the value to "?1"; otherwise,
it sets it to "?0".

Upon receipt of a REGISTER_CLIENT_CID or REGISTER_TARGET_CID capsule,
the proxy validates the registration, tries to establish the appropriate
mappings as described in {{mappings}}.

The proxy MUST reply to each REGISTER_CLIENT_CID capsule with either
an ACK_CLIENT_CID or CLOSE_CLIENT_CID capsule containing the
Connection ID that was in the registration capsule.

Similarly, the proxy MUST reply to each REGISTER_TARGET_CID capsule with
either an ACK_TARGET_CID or CLOSE_TARGET_CID capsule containing the
Connection ID that was in the registration capsule.

The proxy then determines the target-facing socket to associate with the
client's request. This will generally involve performing a DNS lookup for
the target hostname in the CONNECT request, or finding an existing target-facing
socket to the authority. The target-facing socket might already be open due to a
previous request from this client, or another. If the socket is not already
created, the proxy creates a new one. Proxies can choose to reuse target-facing
sockets across multiple UDP proxying requests, or have a unique target-facing socket
for every UDP proxying request.

If a proxy reuses target-facing sockets, it SHOULD store which authorities
(which could be a domain name or IP address literal) are being accessed over a
particular target-facing socket so it can avoid performing a new DNS query and
potentially choosing a different target server IP address which could map to a
different target server.

Target-facing sockets MUST NOT be reused across QUIC and non-QUIC UDP proxy
requests, since it might not be possible to correctly demultiplex or direct
the traffic. Any packets received on a target-facing socket used for proxying
QUIC that does not correspond to a known Connection ID MUST be dropped.

When the proxy recieves a REGISTER_CLIENT_CID capsule, it is receiving a
request to be able to route traffic matching the Client Connection ID back to
the client using the Virtual Client Connection ID. If the pair of this Client
Connection ID and the selected target-facing socket does not create a conflict,
the proxy creates the mapping and responds with a ACK_CLIENT_CID capsule. After
this point, any packets received by the proxy from the target-facing socket that
match the Client Connection ID can to be sent to the client after the proxy has
replaced the Connection ID with the Virtual Client Connection ID. The proxy MUST
use tunnelled mode (HTTP Datagram frames) for any long header packets. The proxy
SHOULD forward directly to the client for any matching short header packets if
forwarding is supported by the client, but the proxy MAY tunnel these packets in
HTTP Datagram frames instead. If the mapping would create a conflict, the proxy
responds with a CLOSE_CLIENT_CID capsule.

When the proxy recieves a REGISTER_TARGET_CID capsule, it is receiving a
request to allow the client to forward packets to the target. The proxy
generates a Virtual Target Connection ID for the client to use when sending
packets in forwarded mode. If forwarded mode is not supported, the proxy MUST
NOT send a Virtual Target Connection ID by setting the length to zero. If
forwarded mode is supported, the proxy MUST use a Virtual Target Connection ID
that does not introduce a conflict with any other Connection ID on the
client-facing socket. The proxy creates the mapping and responds with an
ACK_TARGET_CID capsule. Once the successful response is sent, the proxy will
forward any short header packets received on the client-facing socket that use
the Virtual Target Connection ID using the correct target-facing socket after
first rewriting the Virtual Target Connection ID to be the correct Target
Connection ID.

A proxy that supports forwarded mode but chooses not to support rewriting the
Virtual Target Connection ID to the Target Connection ID may opt to simply let
them be equal. If the proxy does wish to choose a Virtual Target Connection ID,
it MUST be able to replace the Virtual Target Connection ID with the Target
Connection ID and correctly handle length differences between the two.
Regardless of whether or not the proxy chooses to support rewriting of the
Virtual Target Connection ID, it MUST be able to support rewriting the Client
Connection ID to the Virtual Client Connection ID.

If the proxy does not support forwarded mode, or does not allow forwarded mode
for a particular client or authority by policy, it can reject all REGISTER_TARGET_CID
requests with CLOSE_TARGET_CID capsule.

The proxy MUST only forward non-tunnelled packets from the client that are QUIC
short header packets (based on the Header Form bit) and have mapped Virtual Target
Connection IDs. Packets sent by the client that are forwarded SHOULD be
considered as activity for restarting QUIC's Idle Timeout {{QUIC}}.

## Removing Mapping State

For any registration capsule for which the proxy has sent an acknowledgement, any
mappings last until either endpoint sends a close capsule or the either side of the
HTTP stream closes.

A client that no longer wants a given Connection ID to be forwarded by the
proxy sends a CLOSE_CLIENT_CID or CLOSE_TARGET_CID capsule.

If a client's connection to the proxy is terminated for any reason, all
mappings associated with all requests are removed.

A proxy can close its target-facing socket once all UDP proxying requests mapped to
that socket have been removed.

## Handling Connection Migration

If a proxy supports QUIC connection migration, it needs to ensure that a migration
event does not end up sending too many tunnelled or proxied packets on a new
path prior to path validation.

Specifically, the proxy MUST limit the number of packets that it will proxy
to an unvalidated client address to the size of an initial congestion window.
Proxies additionally SHOULD pace the rate at which packets are sent over a new
path to avoid creating unintentional congestion on the new path.

When operating in forwarded mode, the proxy reconfigures or removes forwarding
rules as the network path between the client and proxy changes. In the event of
passive migration, the proxy automatically reconfigures forwarding rules to use
the latest active and validated network path for the HTTP stream. In the event of
active migration, the proxy removes forwarding rules in order to not send
packets with the same connection ID bytes over multiple network paths. After
initiating active migration, clients are no longer able to send forwarded mode
packets since the proxy will have removed forwarding rules. Clients can proceed with
tunnelled mode or can request new forwarding rules via REGISTER_CLIENT_CID and
REGISTER_TARGET_CID capsules. Each of these capsules will contain new virtual
connection IDs to prevent packets with the same connection ID bytes being used
over multiple network paths. Note that the Client Connection ID and Target
Connection ID can stay the same while the Virtual Target Connection ID and
Virtual Client Connection ID change.

## Handling ECN Marking

Explicit Congestion Notification marking {{!ECN=RFC3168}} uses two bits in the IP
header to signal congestion from a network to endpoints. When using forwarded mode,
the proxy replaces IP headers for packets exchanged between the client and target;
these headers can include ECN markings. Proxies SHOULD preserve ECN markings on
forwarded packets in both directions, to allow ECN to function end-to-end. If the proxy does not
preserve ECN markings, it MUST set ECN marks to zero on the IP headers it genrates.

Forwarded mode does not create an IP-in-IP tunnel, so the guidance in
{{?ECN-TUNNEL=RFC6040}} about transferring ECN markings between inner and outer IP
headers does not apply.

A proxy MAY additionally add ECN markings to signal congestion being experienced
on the proxy itself.

# Example

Consider a client that is establishing a new QUIC connection through the proxy.
It has selected a Client Connection ID of 0x31323334. In order to inform a proxy
of the new QUIC Client Connection ID, the client also sends a
REGISTER_CLIENT_CID capsule.

The client will also send the initial QUIC packet with the Long Header form in
an HTTP datagram.

~~~
Client                                             Server

  :method = CONNECT
  :protocol = connect-udp
  :scheme = https
  :path = /target.example.com/443/
  :authority = proxy.example.org
  proxy-quic-forwarding = ?1
  capsule-protocol = ?1

STREAM(44): DATA                -------->
  Capsule Type = REGISTER_CLIENT_CID
  Connection ID = 0x31323334
  Virtual CID = 0x62646668
  Stateless Reset Token = Token

  Quarter Stream ID = 11
  Context ID = 0
  Payload = Encapsulated QUIC initial

           <--------  STREAM(44): HEADERS
                        :status = 200
                        proxy-quic-forwarding = ?1
                        capsule-protocol = ?1

           <--------  STREAM(44): DATA
                        Capsule Type = ACK_CLIENT_CID
                        Connection ID = 0x31323334

/* Wait for target server to respond to UDP packet. */

           <--------  DATAGRAM
                        Quarter Stream ID = 11
                        Context ID = 0
                        Payload = Encapsulated QUIC initial
~~~

Immediately after sending the REGISTER_CLIENT_CID capsule, the client may
receive forwarded mode packets from the proxy with a Virtual Client
Connection ID of 0x62646668 which it will replace with the real Client
Connection ID of 0x31323334. All forwarded mode packets sent by the proxy
will have been modified to contain the Virtual Client Connection ID instead
of the Client Connection ID.

Once the client learns which Connection ID has been selected by the target
server, it can send a new request to the proxy to establish a mapping for
forwarding. In this case, that ID is 0x61626364. The client sends the
following capsule:

~~~
STREAM(44): DATA                -------->
  Capsule Type = REGISTER_TARGET_CID
  Connection ID = 0x61626364

           <--------  STREAM(44): DATA
                        Capsule Type = ACK_TARGET_CID
                        Connection ID = 0x61626364
                        Virtual Target Connection ID = 0x123412341234
                        Stateless Reset Token = Token
~~~

Upon receiving an ACK_TARGET_CID capsule, the client starts sending Short Header
packets with a Destination Connection ID of 0x123412341234 directly to the proxy
(not tunnelled), and these are rewritten by the proxy to have the Destination
Connection ID 0x61626364 prior to being forwarded directly to the target. In the
reverse direction, Short Header packets from the target with a Destination
Connection ID of 0x31323334 are modified to replace the Destination Connection
ID with the Virtual Client Connection ID of 0x62646668 and forwarded directly to
the client.

# Packet Size Considerations

Since Initial QUIC packets must be at least 1200 bytes in length, the HTTP
Datagram frames that are used for a QUIC-aware proxy MUST be able to carry at least
1200 bytes.

Additionally, clients that connect to a proxy for purpose of proxying QUIC
SHOULD start their connection with a larger packet size than 1200 bytes, to
account for the overhead of tunnelling an Initial QUIC packet within an
HTTP Datagram frame. If the client does not begin with a larger packet size than
1200 bytes, it will need to perform Path MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit)
discovery to discover a larger path size prior to sending any tunnelled Initial
QUIC packets.

Once a proxied QUIC connections moves into forwarded mode, the client SHOULD
initiate Path MTU discovery to increase its end-to-end MTU.

# Security Considerations {#security}

Proxies that support this extension SHOULD provide protections to rate-limit
or restrict clients from opening an excessive number of proxied connections, so
as to limit abuse or use of proxies to launch Denial-of-Service attacks.

Sending QUIC packets by forwarding through a proxy without tunnelling exposes
some QUIC header metadata to onlookers, and can be used to correlate packet
flows if an attacker is able to see traffic on both sides of the proxy.
Tunnelled packets have similar inference problems. An attacker on both sides
of the proxy can use the size of ingress and egress packets to correlate packets
belonging to the same connection. (Absent client-side padding, tunnelled packets
will typically have a fixed amount of overhead that is removed before their
HTTP Datagram contents are written to the target.)

Since proxies that forward QUIC packets do not perform any cryptographic
integrity check, it is possible that these packets are either malformed,
replays, or otherwise malicious. This may result in proxy targets rate limiting
or decreasing the reputation of a given proxy.
